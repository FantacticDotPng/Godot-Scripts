# Godot-Scripts
Some scripts for basic functionalities in Godot, such as an advanced character controller.
This is meant to simply be a repository for code for mechanics that I simply don't want to re-program every single time I want to use the mechanic in a project.

That being said, you are free to use any code or Godot scene in this repository without crediting.
On the off chance anyone uses these in any of their projects, I wish you good luck in your project!

so far the scripts/mechanics included are:
- unanimated advanced 2D character controller
